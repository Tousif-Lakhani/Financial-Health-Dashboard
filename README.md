# 💼 Financial Health Dashboard Project

## 📊 Overview

This project explores what makes companies financially healthy or at risk of bankruptcy by analyzing real financial data across different profitability groups.

We filtered and visualized key metrics for three profitability segments:
- **Bottom 25% (Low Profitability)**
- **Middle 50% (Moderate Profitability)**
- **Top 25% (High Profitability)**

Each dashboard image shows how these groups differ in terms of financial health, operational efficiency, cash flow behavior, and R&D investment impact.

## 🖼️ Dashboards Included

### **1. Top 25% Profitability Group (`Top_25.png`)**
Shows high-performing companies with strong financials.
- Highlights efficient asset use, better cash flow, and strategic R&D spending.
- Compares bankrupt vs. non-bankrupt companies using radar charts, bar graphs, and scatter plots.

### **2. Middle 50% Profitability Group (`Middle_50.png`)**
Represents average-performing companies.
- Shows moderate levels of efficiency, cash flow, and debt.
- Helps identify trends that fall between high and low performers.

### **3. Bottom 25% Profitability Group (`Bottom_25.png`)**
Focuses on underperforming companies.
- Reveals inefficiencies, poor cash flow, and higher risk of financial distress.
- Useful for identifying early warning signs of bankruptcy.

## 🔍 Key Insights from the Dashboards

### 1. What predicts bankruptcy?
- **High Debt Ratio**: Companies with too much debt are more likely to fail.
- **Low Interest Coverage Ratio**: Inability to pay interest on debts is a red flag.
- **Poor Net Profit Before Tax**: Low profitability leads to instability.
- **Low ROA (Return on Assets)**: Poor asset use means lower returns.

### 2. How do profitable companies differ?
- **Higher ROA**: They use their assets more effectively.
- **Better Cash Flow Metrics**: They generate more cash relative to their size.
- **Stronger Operational Efficiency**: They manage costs and resources better.

### 3. What about cash flow & reinvestment?
- **Financially Stable Companies**:
  - Maintain strong **Cash Flow to Sales** and **Cash Flow to Total Assets**.
  - Reinvest wisely and maintain liquidity.
- **Companies at Risk**:
  - Show declining or inconsistent cash flows.
  - Struggle with reinvestment and debt management.

### 4. Does R&D investment matter?
- Yes! Companies that invest moderately in **R&D** tend to have better long-term performance (higher ROA).
- But after a point, more spending doesn’t always mean better results — suggesting **diminishing returns**.
